## Frequently Asked Questions
What is FlowCV and how does it work?
Is FlowCV really free?
Why is FlowCV free?
Can I save multiple resume versions on FlowCV?
How does FlowCV protect my data?
[Privacy Policy](https://flowcv.com/privacy-policy)
Does FlowCV support multiple languages?
Can I also create cover letters with FlowCV?
Are FlowCV resumes ATS-friendly?
Yes. FlowCV exports clean, text-based PDFs with embedded fonts and simple structure, so ATS tools can read your resume without issues—even with two-column templates; if you're worried about very old systems, it's safest to pick a one-column layout.
In practice, what matters most is that a human can quickly skim your resume, so focus on clear headings, relevant keywords, and impact-focused bullets.
Can I import an existing resume into FlowCV?
Is FlowCV top-rated by users?
