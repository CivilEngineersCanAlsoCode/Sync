# Structural Editorial Review: Context.md

## Document Summary

- **Purpose:** Consolidated source of truth for the Sync project.
- **Audience:** Developers, Project Managers, and Stakeholders.
- **Reader type:** Humans.
- **Structure model:** Strategic/Context (Pyramid).
- **Current length:** ~450 words across 10 sections.

## Recommendations

### 1. MOVE - Executive Summary

**Rationale:** In a Pyramid model, the core conclusion/summary must be the headline, not nested under "Part 1".
**Impact:** ~100% improvement in initial orientation.

### 2. MERGE - Success Metrics & Non-Functional Requirements

**Rationale:** "Speed", "Privacy", and "Performance" are mentioned in both Part 1 and Part 2, creating true redundancy.
**Impact:** ~40 words reduction/consolidation.

### 3. MOVE - Technical Stack & Infrastructure

**Rationale:** Moving these from Part 2 (Product Requirements) to Part 3 (Technical Strategy) keeps requirements focused on _what_ the system does rather than _how_ it's built.
**Impact:** Improved logical grouping.

### 4. CONDENSE - Competitive Reference

**Rationale:** The current prose in Part 4 can be tightened into a MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) comparison list to respect limited attention spans.
**Impact:** ~30 words reduction.

## Summary

- **Total recommendations:** 4
- **Estimated reduction:** ~70 words (15% of original)
- **Meets length target:** No target specified, focused on density.
- **Comprehension trade-offs:** Minimal; reordering improves cognitive flow without sacrificing depth.
