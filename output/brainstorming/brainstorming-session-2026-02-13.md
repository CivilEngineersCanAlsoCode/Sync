# Brainstorming Session Results

**Facilitator:** Satvik
**Date:** 2026-02-13

## Session Overview

**Topic:** Home Dashboard Analytics & Visualization
**Goals:** Identify impactful analytics widgets for the dashboard that track job application progress, resume precision (fitting), and relevance (similarity) to job descriptions.

### Session Setup

We are brainstorming analytics and visualization widgets for the Home Dashboard of the Resume Personalisation "Sync" tool.

**Key Context:**

- **Core Concept:** "Precision Fitting" - rewriting resume sentences to fit perfectly into a fixed LaTeX layout (one-page, no spillover).
- **User Journey:** User creates multiple custom resumes for different jobs from a base layout.
- **Goal:** Provide insights into the user's job search progress and the quality/relevance of their tailored resumes.

**Desired Outcomes:**

- Ideas for visual graphs/charts (e.g., Shortlist %, Similarity Score).
- Concepts for tracking "Precision" (how well the resume fits the layout).
- Analytics related to specific projects/skills vs. job descriptions.
- **New Ideas:** Usage statistics (Time to tailor), Value Realisation (Alignment increase baseline vs. final), Future: Interview Prep (Q&A models).

## Technique Selection

**Approach:** Progressive Technique Flow
**Journey Design:** Systematic development from exploration to action

**Progressive Techniques:**

- **Phase 1 - Exploration:** **Analogical Thinking** for broad idea generation (metaphors).
- **Phase 2 - Pattern Recognition:** **SCAMPER Method** for refining and expanding ideas.
- **Phase 3 - Development:** **Solution Matrix** for evaluating impact vs. effort.
- **Phase 4 - Action Planning:** **Decision Tree Mapping** for implementation paths.

**Journey Rationale:** This flow moves from creative metaphors (to find novel visualizations) -> refinement -> selection -> clear implementation steps. It accommodates the user's specific data points (time, alignment) while leaving room for future concepts like interview prep.
